# SARS-CoV2 Project Ideas

## Masks / respirators

### Testing
+ structured / easy way to quantify efficiency
	-	NaCl aerosol generator
	-	automated detector?
+ easy way to quantify fit? (mobile app/image analysis?)

### Sterilization of used masks
+ https://focustaiwan.tw/society/202002020012 - UVC disinfection, ethyl alcohol disinfection

### Designs

+ NaCL filter impregnation for antiviral properties - https://www.nature.com/articles/srep39956
+ Common materials evaluated for filter efficiency - https://academic.oup.com/annweh/article/54/7/789/202744
+ Mask out of cotton t-shirts - https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/12/6/05-1468_article

## Home Isolation / Disinfection
+ negative pressure bedroom fan w/ uvc sterlization
+ UVC sterilizer for bathrooms
	- door switch to detect opening/closing of door
	- light sensor to detect room occupancy
	- buzzer to sound alert prior to lamp activation
	- bluetooth connection to mobile app to view status?
+ checklist for sterilization

### Research
+ simple/cheap uvc filter?- We report here that a Pyrex dish provides an effective, stable, robust and inexpensive filter for reducing or excluding the contribution of UVC to damage induced by broad-spectrum 'UVB' lamps. - https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9639912
